          <h3>Italy</h3>
          <p>
            Epicentre of the Roman Empire and birthplace of the Renaissance,
            this European virtuoso groans under the weight of its cultural
            cachet: it's here that you'll stand in the presence of
            Michelangelo's David and Sistine Chapel frescoes, Botticelli's Birth
            of Venus and Primavera and da Vinci's The Last Supper. In fact,
            Italy has more Unesco World Heritage cultural sites than any other
            country on Earth. Should you walk in the footsteps of ancient Romans
            in Pompeii, revel in Ravenna's glittering Byzantine treasures or get
            breathless over Giotto's revolutionary frescoes in Padua? It's a
            cultural conundrum as thrilling as it is overwhelming.

          <h3>Oman</h3>
          <p>
            For visitors, this offers a rare chance to engage with the Arab
            world without the distorting lens of excessive wealth. Oman's
            low-rise towns retain their traditional charms, and Bedouin values
            remain at the heart of an Omani welcome. With an abundance of
            natural beauty, from spectacular mountains, wind-blown deserts and a
            pristine coastline, Oman is the obvious choice for those seeking out
            the modern face of Arabia while wanting still to sense its ancient
            soul.
