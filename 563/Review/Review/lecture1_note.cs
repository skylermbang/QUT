WHat is the programming process :
    Designing instruction to tell the computer what to do

     Software :   1.  Systsem software   : OS
                  2.   Application software: allow the user to do what they want


     Hardware :  Physical device -


     Machine language - expressed by 0 and 1 ;
     High-level programming language (C#, python , Java ... ): use a reasonable key word like "read" ,"write" and "add"
                                       Allow user to locate the memory
                                       Each high-level language has its own syntax
                                       Use correct programming logic - 


     compiler translates high-level language to machine language


Procedural and Object-Oriented programming :

Procedural (component-oriented) programming: creates and names computer memory locations that can hold values (varibles) that are referenced by using a one-word name
                         Write a sereis of steps of operations  - lot variables  - lots steps  
                         Procdeures or Methodes :  grouping variables methodes



Object-oriented programming (OOP) :  etensio nof procedural programming ; focues on objects that contatins the variables
                                      Objects :   ex) bank account ;
                                                 property (attributes) : represent its characterisitcs
                                                 behavior (methode) : things the object does

                                                             Calss : Category of thing 
                                                            class Name:   Videoo
                                                            Attribute :   title , running time 
                                                            Methoude :   create(), play()
  Common features :
                                                                 inheritance :  it inehrit all the property of its parents  
                                                                 encapsulation : ability to contain all the attributes and methods  in one package
                                                                 polymorphism : ability of different objects work properly based on its data type  



Writing a C# progarm that produces output :

    Literal String :  ""
    Argument :   inside parenthesis (bracket)
    Methoudes  :
    Namespace :  group similar classes  , inside of Namesapce lots of classes
    Methode header:  static void 
    Methode body :   between {}
    whitespace : combinations of space / tab => organize code
    Keyword :  such as void
    Methode name is Main() ;  application calsses

    if they dont have main() then its non-application class

    void : return type 

Selecting Identifiers :

    how to select identifiers in C#

    identifiers are names for program components - class , namespaces , variables , objects, methods es,


    classes,methods, and namespaces start with uppercase letter :
    no space betwwen whitespace , only letters, digits , @ ,
    no cant be C# reserved , and importand words like such , delete ... etc

    public class Gretting
    pubulic class DisplayBusinessPlan



    variables, obects, and keywrods start with lowercasee (using camel case):
    totalScore = firsthalfScore + secondHalgScores;


Comments and using the system Namespaces:
    program comments :

    line comments  : //
    block comments : /* */

using system namespace :        using System.console =>    WriteLine("blach blach");



Compiling and Executing a C# program :

compile the program :  converting your code into machine language 
you can compile either CLI or IDE ;

CLI :   csc blach.cs



if you get OS erroer message =>  check missepll, location of the file ,

if you get programming languege erroer msg = > your syntax has erroer   writeLine => WriteLine => case sensitive
